GRAPH MINING
-----

The Graph Mining application uses Apache Spark or Apache Flink to find either the maximum Truss or all specific k-Trusses in a graph.

The input file is expected to consist of one line per edge in the graph. Each line must begin with an integer followed by a separator and another integer. Both these integer must equate to node IDs in the graph.
